# PATMO_sulfur_cycle
##Changes made in the code added: PATMO budget module, patmo_budget.f90.
##In patmo_ode.f90 added yield for COS from CS2 + DMS reactions towards COS (I did however remove these reactions + yields to see if steady state S was reached)
##We calculated much higher emissions and added that as input 
##Due to high emisssions we tuned the dry deposition. 
##Added end_of_run parameter to have output only at the end of the run.
